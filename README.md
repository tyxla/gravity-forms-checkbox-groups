Gravity Forms - Checkbox Groups
===============================

## About

Gravity Forms: Checkbox Group is an addon for the Gravity Forms WordPress plugin.

Usually, if you have a long list of options in your Checkboxes field, groups of related options are easier to handle for a user. Unfortunately, Gravity Forms does not support groups of options. Not until you install this plugin.

This plugin allows you to group the options in checkboxes fields by implementing &lt;groups&gt; within the native field interface.

## How to Use

The plugin adds an "Add a Group" button between the "Add an Option" and "Remove an Option" buttons next to each option in the "Checkboxes" field.

Clicking this button next to an option will create a new group just below after that particular option. You should then input the label of this group. 

A group can't be selected, so there is no checkbox button for making it a default value. Also, if the first option in the list of options is a group, the selected option in the frontend will be the first option that isn't in any group. 

You can reorder the groups just like you can reorder your options - by using the drag &amp; drop interface.

You can create as many groups as you wish, and you can insert as many options as you want below those groups.

In case you disable the "Gravity Forms: Checkbox Groups" plugin, the groups will be displayed as options. Once you reenable it, they will again be displayed as groups just like before.
